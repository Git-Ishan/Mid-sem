<h2>Configuration Structure</h2>

To ensure scalability and maintainability, the repository follows a structured format:

Repository Root contains global configuration files like versions.tf.
  Environments Directory holds isolated folders for each environment (e.g., environments/dev) with their own main.tf, variables.tf, and state files, allowing environment-specific configurations.
Modules Directory includes reusable Terraform modules such as networking, compute, loadbalancer, and nginx. Each module has its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf, making the setup modular and easy to manage.

    Implementation in Jenkins
    Jenkins is configured as a controller node with the required Pipeline Utility Steps Plugin, along with Git and Azure CLI for automation.
    For Azure authentication, Service Principal credentials (Client ID, Secret, Tenant ID, Subscription ID) are stored securely in Jenkins using the Credentials Manager as a single JSON ‚ÄúSecret Text‚Äù. A Groovy script then parses these values and runs the az login --service-principal command.
    Other sensitive details, like VM administrator passwords, are also stored as Secret Text credentials and are masked in the pipeline logs for security.

Jenkins Pipeline Flow

The Groovy-based Jenkinsfile automates the Terraform workflow.
The Environment Setup stage defines all secrets using credentials().
The Azure Login Stage authenticates to Azure CLI using a Service Principal.
The Terraform Init Stage runs terraform init -upgrade inside the environment directory (e.g., environments/dev).
The Terraform Plan Stage executes terraform plan -out=tfplan, generating the plan file.
The Terraform Apply Stage runs only if APPLY_CHANGES is true, applying the plan using terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan.

The pipeline ensures secure credentials handling, clear separation of stages, and controlled deployment execution.

    Implementation in Azure Pipelines
    The Azure DevOps pipeline is defined declaratively in the azure-pipelines.yml file.
    Authentication is managed through a Service Connection (named azure-terraform-connection in this project) created in the Project Settings.
    This securely handles all permissions and eliminates the manual JSON credential handling required by Jenkins. 
    Other secrets, like the virtual machine's admin_password, are stored as Pipeline Secret Variables to ensure they are never exposed in logs.


The `azure-pipelines.yml` file defines a two-stage process that runs on a self-hosted agent. The **Plan** stage first installs Terraform, then runs `terraform init` to prepare the project. Afterwards, it executes `terraform plan`, using a secret variable for the VM password, and saves the resulting `tfplan` file as a pipeline artifact.

The **Apply** stage then begins by downloading the `tfplan` artifact from the previous stage. It runs `terraform init` again to set up the environment and finally executes `terraform apply` on the downloaded plan, ensuring that only the exact changes reviewed in the plan are deployed to Azure.

## üìñ My Journey & Key Learnings

This project was a significant learning experience involving extensive real-world troubleshooting:

* **Cross-Platform Challenges:** The project was initially attempted on Linux and later transitioned to a fresh Windows environment, which required debugging `PATH` variable issues for tools like the Azure CLI and Docker.
* **Terraform Debugging:** I encountered and solved a wide variety of Terraform errors, from simple typos and inconsistent dependency lock files (`terraform init -upgrade`) to complex state file corruption that required manual resource deletion in Azure.
* **CI/CD Troubleshooting:** Setting up the pipelines involved challenges like installing missing Marketplace extensions in Azure DevOps, configuring a self-hosted agent to bypass free tier limitations, and fixing permissions by correctly assigning IAM roles (`Contributor`) to the Service Principal.
* **Git Repository Management:** A key lesson was realizing a missing `.gitignore` file caused the repository to bloat to over 100MB. I learned to clean the repository history using commands like `git rm --cached`, `git reset`, and `git push --force`.
